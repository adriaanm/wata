# WATA-TODO — known debt that moves out with the Wata code

*Created 2026-07-12 (designer session, during the graduation-brief
sweep-3 audit). Wata continues in its own repo (on Sgola); this doc
rides along with the code when it moves. Scope: Wata-app debt only —
anything sgola-direct lives in GRADUATION-BRIEF.md / the sgola
registry instead. Sources: M7/M8 brief scoreboards + ROADMAP exit
blocks + git log; each entry cites where it was recorded.*

## wata-server spec conformance

- **`limited` is never set, and `/messages` `from` tokens are event
  ids, not sync tokens** (M8 ch.4 live-fire find): the Zig backfill
  recipe silently loses mid-history-join history against this
  server. The Sgola client carries a client-side workaround
  (our-own-join triggers a tail fetch, ingested oldest-first); the
  server fix was noted as a "post-M8 candidate" and never made.
  Fix `limited` + a real pagination token at minimum.
- **Unexercised surface** (M7 exit "Open/deferred", dispositions
  stand unchallenged but untested): `/messages` non-sequential
  pagination, `/publicRooms`, `createRoom` extras
  (initial_state/creation_content/PL-override).
- **The `/sync` allocation tax** (M7 exit: "the strongest perf
  lever") — profiled, recorded, unscheduled.
- **The actor-store refactor** — recorded M7 verdict: no evidence
  demands it; keep as a non-goal unless load says otherwise.
- Behavior pin worth remembering: wata-server does NOT auto-create
  users (seeded alice/bob in all harnesses).

## client / device

- **tinyalsa vendored patch — upstream call never made** (M8 ch.6:
  `grep "SGOLA PATCH" vendor/tinyalsa/src/pcm.c`; pull-mode
  sync_ptr on non-MMAP handles, kernel-semantics-correct, fixes the
  long-standing replay/stutter bug that also afflicted the Zig
  client). Decide: upstream it, or pin vendored-forever with the
  reason written down.
- **FFmpeg EOS-flag nuance on our Ogg/Opus output** (DOGFOOD M8
  ch.6b) — one look, as promised there: third-party tools reading
  our streams is ecosystem courtesy. (The writer itself is
  ci-oracled byte-exact; this is about the EOS flag convention.)
- **dot2 input bus undiscovered** (M8 ch.7): input handling opens
  /dev/input/event{0,1,2} only — a gap SHARED with the original Zig
  client (mirrored faithfully, out of port scope then). If dot2
  matters, discover its bus properly.
- **/dev/shm Zig-binary backup is transient** (M8 pickup note) —
  gone on reboot; the Zig client at /opt/wata was replaced in place
  by the Sgola binary. If a rollback artifact is wanted, store it
  somewhere durable.

## sgola-side items that Wata is waiting on (tracked THERE, not here)

- `go.Slice[T]` sub-slicing (blocked the Opus decoder consumer) —
  GRADUATION-BRIEF ch.D.
- cgo cross-targets beyond linux/arm (a second device target) —
  GRADUATION-BRIEF consumer-driven ledger.
- ADT-valued `Atomic` cells / RWMutex reader-parallel cell — same
  ledger, first-consumer-triggered (Wata is the likely consumer).
